::  P4D configuration has completed successfully.
::
::  Here is what has been done so far:
::
::  - Your p4d service settings have been written to
::    the following p4dctl configuration file:
::      /etc/perforce/p4dctl.conf.d/muffins.conf
::  - The p4d service has been initialized with the P4ROOT:
::      /opt/perforce/servers/muffins/root
::  - The p4d service has been started with the P4PORT: ssl:1666
::  - The p4d service has been set to Security Level 3.
::  - The new Perforce super-user 'takamuffin' has been created and the
::    password has been set to the one specified.
::
::  Here is what you can do now:
::
::  - You can manage it with the 'perforce' user, using the following:
::
::      sudo -u perforce p4dctl <cmd>
::
::  - You can connect to it by setting the P4PORT and P4USER
::    environment variables and running 'p4 <cmd>'. For example, run:
::
::      export P4PORT=ssl:1666
::      export P4USER=takamuffin
::
::      p4 login
::
::    For help, run:
::
::      p4 help
::
::  - To connect to this p4d service from another machine, include
::    this machine's name or IP address in the P4PORT. For example:
::
::      export P4PORT=ssl:172.23.231.125:1666
